# parcel

🔹 Core Purpose
An on-demand, home-to-home delivery app for everyone in the city — individuals, small businesses, students, etc., for any kind of parcel that’s legal and allowed for transport.

🔹 Roles Confirmed ✅
Role	Description
🧍 User (Sender)	Schedules and tracks deliveries
🛵 Delivery Agent	Accepts and fulfills delivery tasks
🧑‍💼 Admin (You)	Oversees everything but isn’t a bottleneck

✅ Change Added: Agents can auto-accept orders if available — admin intervention is optional, not mandatory.

We’ll implement:

Auto-matching: agents get notifications

Manual override: admin can assign, reassign, or cancel

🔹 Updated User Journey Flow
🧍 User:
Login → Book Parcel → Enter Pickup/Drop → Confirm → Real-Time Tracking → Payment → Review
🛵 Agent:
Login → Get Notified of New Order → View Details → Accept or Ignore → Navigate → Pickup → Deliver → Mark Complete
🧑‍💼 Admin:
Login → View All Orders (Pending/Accepted/Completed) → Assign or Reassign Orders → Add/Edit Agents → Analytics & Earnings
